Welcome to MyoSuite's documentation!
=====================================

`MyoSuite <https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite>`_  is a collection of musculoskeletal environments and tasks simulated with the `MuJoCo <http://www.mujoco.org/>`_ physics engine and wrapped in the OpenAI ``gym`` API to enable the application of Machine Learning to bio-mechanic control problems.

Check our `github repository <https://github.com/MyoHub/myosuite>`__ for more technical details.

Our paper can be found at: `https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13600 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13600>`__

Advanced user are invited to familiarize themselves with the basics of the `OpenAI Gym API <https://gymnasium.farama.org/>`__ and review the basic principle of Reinforcement Learning to make the most out of MyoSuite features and functionalities
